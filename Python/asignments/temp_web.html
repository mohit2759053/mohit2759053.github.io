    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: bignoodletitling; color: black; font: bold;"> Amazing and
        Evidence-Supported Health</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-family: bignoodletitling; font: bold;"> Benefits of Running</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center; font-family:italic; font-weight: 400;">Running can give you a longer life, better
        sleep, improved immunity, mood and more—it’s even good for your knees and lower back.</p>

    <h1>Benefit 1. Running adds years to your life and life to your years.</h1>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Numerous studies have shown that running
        increases lifespan. This has led to the oft-repeated observation: “If exercise were a pill, it would be the most
        popular pill in the world.” Worth noting: It would also be the least expensive, with little to no cost.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">A 2018 meta-analysis of research on
        running and longevity found that runners have about a 25 to 30 percent lower rate of all-cause mortality on
        follow-up than non runners. It concluded: “Any amount of running, even once a week, is better than no running.”
    </p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Another runner-specific paper showed that
        runners gain about three years of extra life. Why? Some of the biological pathways include: greater
        cardiovascular fitness, better body composition (less fat), lower cholesterol, excellent glucose and insulin
        control, stronger bones, better hormone regulation, and positive neurological functioning.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Few of us, however, simply want to live
        longer. Rather, we hope for a long, productive, healthy, active life. That’s where running and high-fitness
        shine. Since “seniors” consume a high percent of the public-health budget with their late-life illnesses, much
        research is targeted at what can be done to keep them healthy. Exercise nearly always wins this race.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">For example, recent research at Ball State
        University found that a group of 75-year-old lifetime runners and bicyclists (who had been exercising for 50
        years) had biological profiles closer to 25-year-old graduate students than to their non-exercising 75-year-old
        peers.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">In another famous study, Stanford
        researchers compared local runners in their mid-50s with non-exercising Stanford community members who had the
        same top-notch medical care. Twenty-one years later, the death rate was more than 50 percent lower among the
        runners. More unexpectedly, the runners were reaching certain “disability scores” 11 to 16 years later than the
        non-runners. In other words, they were staying younger for longer. And the older the subjects became, the
        greater the advantages seen among runners.</p>

    <h1>Benefit 2. Running helps you sleep better.</h1>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">If you haven’t seen numerous articles on
        the importance of sleep in recent years, you’ve been, well, asleep under a rock somewhere. And sleep may be
        especially important for athletes. After all, it’s when the body performs all its repair work. In Good to Go,
        her book on sports recovery, science writer Christie Aschwanden rates sleep as one of the few recovery
        “techniques” that’s actually supported by good evidence.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">According to experts from Johns Hopkins,
        “We have solid evidence that exercise does, in fact, help you fall asleep more quickly and improves sleep
        quality.” An article in the American Journal of Lifestyle Exercise notes that the exercise-sleep connection goes
        both ways. The more you exercise, the more you need quality sleep. Also, the worse your sleep habits, the less
        likely you are to exercise regularly.</p>
    <hr color="black">

    <h1>Benefit 3. Running can improve your knees and back.</h1>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">This is one running benefit that many find
        difficult to believe. They reason that running is an impact sport, which must be bad on the joints. What’s more,
        everyone knows a few runners who developed knee pain, and had to switch to bicycling. True enough, but it’s also
        true that sedentary, out-of-shape adults have worse knee and back problems, on average, than most runners.</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Looking for proof? Okay, fair enough.
        Here’s a study that compared 675 marathon runners with non-active controls, and concluded: “In our cohort, the
        arthritis rate of active marathoners was below that of the general U.S. population.” Even ultramarathoners seem
        to fare just fine. When researchers looked at the knees of runners who had just completed a multiday, 2700-mile
        run across Europe, they found that “The extreme running burden seems not to have a relevant negative influence
        on the femoropatellar joint [knee joint] tissues.”</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">In a study of 44 first-time marathon
        runners (17 men and 27 women), researchers noted that post-marathon: “The knees of novice runners achieved
        sustained improvement, for at least 6 months post-marathon, in the condition of their bone marrow and articular
        cartilage.” Same goes for the lower back. In a 2020 report titled “Long-term running in middle-aged men and
        intervertebral disc health, a cross-sectional pilot study,” investigators looked at disc spacing in veteran
        runners vs. non-runners. The finding: “Middle-aged long-term endurance runners exhibit less age-related decline
        in their lumbar IVDs [intervertebral disc height].” And the more years subjects had been running, the better
        their disc-spacing looked. Likewise for weekly mileage. More running was better.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">The Top 5 Benefits of Regular Exercise</h1>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Exercise is defined as any movement that
        makes your muscles work and requires your body to burn calories.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">There are many types of physical activity,
        including swimming, running, jogging, walking, and dancing, to name a few.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Being active has been shown to have many
        health benefits, both physically and mentally. It may even help you live longer (1Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Here are the top 10 ways regular exercise
        benefits your body and brain.</p>
    <img src="images/7.jpg " width="100%" height="500px" style="margin-top: 20px;">


    <h1>1. It can make you feel happier</h1>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">
        Exercise has been shown to improve your mood and decrease feelings of depression, anxiety, and stress (2Trusted
        Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">It produces changes in the parts of the
        brain that regulate stress and anxiety. It can also increase brain sensitivity for the hormones serotonin and
        norepinephrine, which relieve feelings of depression (3Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Additionally, exercise can increase the
        production of endorphins, which are known to help produce positive feelings and reduce the perception of pain
        (Trusted Source3Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Furthermore, exercise has been shown to
        reduce stress and improve symptoms of anxiety (3Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Interestingly, it doesn’t matter how
        intense your workout is. It seems that your mood can benefit from exercise no matter the intensity of the
        physical activity.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">In fact, a study in 24 women who had been
        diagnosed with depression showed that exercise of any intensity significantly decreased feelings of depression
        (4Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">The effects of exercise on mood are so
        powerful that choosing to exercise (or not) even makes a difference over short periods.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">One review of 19 studies found that active
        people who stopped exercising regularly experienced significant increases in symptoms of depression and anxiety,
        even after only a few weeks (5Trusted Source).</p>

    <h1>2. It can help with weight loss</h1>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Some studies have shown that inactivity is
        a major factor in weight gain and obesity (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">To understand the effect of exercise on
        weight reduction, it is important to understand the relationship between exercise and energy expenditure.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Your body spends energy in three ways:</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">digesting food</p>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">exercising</p>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">maintaining body functions like your
        heartbeat and breathing</p>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">While dieting, a reduced calorie intake
        will lower your metabolic rate, which can delay weight loss.</p>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; "> On the contrary, regular exercise has
        been shown to increase your metabolic rate, which can burn more calories to help you lose weight (Trusted
        Source6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Additionally, studies have shown that
        combining aerobic exercise with resistance training can maximize fat loss and muscle mass maintenance, which is
        essential for keeping the weight off</p>

    <hr color="black">

    <h1>3. It is good for your muscles and bones</h1>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Exercise plays a vital role in building
        and maintaining strong muscles and bones.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Activities like weightlifting can
        stimulate muscle building when paired with adequate protein intake.</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">This is because exercise helps release
        hormones that promote the ability of your muscles to absorb amino acids. This helps them grow and reduces their
        breakdown (12Trusted Source, 13Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">As people age, they tend to lose muscle
        mass and function, which can lead to an increased risk of injury. Practicing regular physical activity is
        essential to reducing muscle loss and maintaining strength as you age (14Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Also, exercise helps build bone density
        when you’re younger, in addition to helping prevent osteoporosis later in life (15Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Interestingly, some research suggests that
        high impact exercise, such as gymnastics or running, or odd impact sports, such as soccer and basketball, may
        help promote a higher bone density than non-impact sports like swimming and cycling (16Trusted Source).</p>

    <hr color="black">
    <h1>4. It can increase your energy levels</h1>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Exercise can be a real energy booster for
        many people, including those with various medical conditions (17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">One older study found that 6 weeks of
        regular exercise reduced feelings of fatigue for 36 people who had reported persistent fatigue (19).</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Furthermore, exercise can significantly
        increase energy levels for people with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and other serious illnesses (20Trusted
        Source, 21Trusted Source).</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">In fact, exercise seems to be more
        effective at combating CFS than other treatments, including passive therapies like relaxation and stretching or
        no treatment at all (20Trusted Source).</p>


    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Additionally, exercise has been shown to
        increase energy levels in people with other conditions like cancer (21Trusted Source).</p>

    <hr color="black">
    <h1>5. It can reduce your risk of chronic disease</h1>
    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Lack of regular physical activity is a
        primary cause of chronic disease (22Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">Regular exercise has been shown to improve
        insulin sensitivity, heart health, and body composition. It can also decrease blood pressure and cholesterol
        levels (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">In contrast, a lack of regular exercise —
        even in the short term — can lead to significant increases in belly fat, which may increase the risk of type 2
        diabetes and heart disease (22Trusted Source).</p>

    <p style="  text-indent: 50px; text-align: justify;letter-spacing: 2px; ">That’s why regular physical activity is
        recommended to reduce belly fat and decrease the risk of developing these conditions (27Trusted Source).</p>
